Web app for a students cafeteria.
The students are able to find their name in a table and select and assign -all by themselves- different statuses for their meals and schedules during the week.

The cooks and the personel in charge of the kitchen can check a summary of the day's orders, who cancelled their food, who ordered may be a diet-type of food, among other different classes of "meal statuses"; as well as take a look at individual students orders throughout the week.

Anyone can add guests or invited person to eat and assign a status for their food.

Some admin users are the ones in charge of adding and removing users into the system.

Web app written in PHP using CodeIgniter Framework and MySQL for the backend. Front end built using Bootstrap and interactions with ajax using jQuery.
